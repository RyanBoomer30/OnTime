# CSCI S-33a Final-Project
Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

# Introduction
This website is a project managing app powered by the framework Django with Python as backend and HTML, CSS, Javascript as frontend. The user will be able to create multiple unique projects, add/edit as many tasks and todo lists as they want, and change status of a list to finished or unfinished.

# Main Page
From the main page, which can be accessed from any page using the navigation tab, you can create a project by entering its name into the input box and click enter. Signing in is a requirement to use the app as each user will have their own unique set of projects. After creating a project, you will be able to see the list of all of your created projects listed below the input box. On the left of each project name will be an entered field icon that allow the user to enter the project page, and on the right will be a trash icon that allow the user to delete the project.
